# Anything Tanzu/TKG

## Demystifying the "Tanzu" name
In it's current state, Broadcom has separated the kubernetes runtime from the Tanzu business unit and moved it under the VCF division.  
As a result, the Tanzu naming that is still broadly used, will disappear over time. 

This runtime is known under many names:  
- TKGs (Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service)  
- WCP (Workload Control Plane)  
- Workload Management  
- vSphere with Tanzu  
- vSphere IAAS Control Plane  
- vSphere Supervisor
